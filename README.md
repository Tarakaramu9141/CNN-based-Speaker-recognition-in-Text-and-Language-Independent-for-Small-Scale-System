 # CNN-based-Speaker-recognition-in-Text-and-Language-Independent-for-Small-Scale-System
 
 This document provides a comprehensive overview of a CNN-based speaker recognition system, designed for both text-dependent and text-independent speaker recognition. This project utilizes a lightweight and language-independent architecture, making it suitable for small-scale applications.

 # Project Overview and Features
 This speaker recognition system leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract discriminative features from audio signals. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained on a dataset of speech recordings. The model learns to differentiate between various speakers based on their unique vocal characteristics.

Here are some key features of the system:

Text-dependent and text-independent speaker recognition capabilities

Language-independent architecture, enabling recognition across diverse languages

Optimized for small-scale datasets and computational resources

High accuracy and robustness to background noise

The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable. It can be easily customized for various applications, such as:

Voice authentication for secure access to devices or systems

Speaker identification in audio recordings

Personalized voice-based services

Content analysis and speaker segmentation

# Installation and Usage Instructions
This section outlines the steps for installing and using the speaker recognition system. The instructions are provided for both Linux and Windows operating systems. Detailed instructions and code snippets are provided on the project's GitHub repository.

To start using the system, follow these steps:
